# Motivation

Financial freedom, living from your own companies/projects. You want to work from anywhere and be financially stable enough to support yourself (and any dependants).

You have a a long list of ideas to create micro SaaS projects and bring in some money and you know success won't happen over night. You'll need to leave your SaaS online for some time and do some marketing to attract customers. Because of this hosting should be cheap and reliable. Ideally as you add a new site, your costs won't increase.

SEO is important to help customers discover your website. You need a way to publish optimised landing pages and track their conversion rates. This will help you better understand your potential user base and what they are searching for.

Setting realistic expectations, you're not going to be the next Facebook. It's highly probable you won't even get any users. But you want to try. You believe in your ideas and want to bring them to the world. You'll be over the moon if you can reach 1'000 users.

Success to you is a project that brings in money to cover the costs of running itself and the time you invested in it. Anything more goes towards your goal of being financially independent from your projects.

Because of this you have sanity checked your business model. If your target budget is $5'000/month and you can make $5/customer, you're aiming for 1'000 customers.

You pick boring technologies. Boring technologies are the ones you know, that a lot of people know. They are mature and stable. This is not the time to be learning new things. New things require more time. They often "go wrong" as you find out their quirks. Worse, immature things likely have bugs that will hinder your progress.

You know that every project takes time and effort to build. Regardless of which idea you pick, you know there will be some repeated things you need to include: authentication, authorization, payments, documentation, support, backups etc.

Every project follows the same template. Common functionality should be ready to go in the template. You don't need context switching or the additional effort of holding many different technologies in your head at the same time. Any change in one project should be easily reproducible in another.

Despite being a solo-developer or a small (<10 people) team, you still want to offer a great experience. Clean design; clear documentation; contact details for help & support; self-service billing management - all of these are additional yet essential parts.

When things go wrong you receive an automated alert (not from a customer) and have backups to restore from. Downtime is acceptable, data-loss is not.

You respect your users privacy and security. Services are setup securely by default with regular deployments for security updates. To ensure minimal disruption you leverage static types and maintain a test suite with reasonable coverage to catch bugs before they hit production.

While you make a conscious effort to keep the number of external services low, you know this is unavoidable. To minimise maintenance effort you leverage the multi-tenancy features to share these services between your projects.

You need to understand your finances and your project demand so you build Business Intelligence dashboards that show your revenue (total and by project), your expenses (total and by project) and expected profit (before taxes). You also have graphs showing top performing landing pages, user flow and churn rate that you use to fine tune your projects.

In the end you will have a collection of projects, built on the same foundation. Some will bring in more than others. Some may not bring in anything at all. Across all of them though, you've hit your goal. Your choice now is whether to grow them more, create new projects or try to keep everything as it is.
